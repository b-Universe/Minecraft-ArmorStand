In Minecraft 1.8 Armor stands were introduced. Unfortunately, the syntax to summon one is quite confusing and not very intuitive, especially when you're trying to create an awesome pose. This tool provides a graphical interface so that you can focus on the looks and not worry about the code.

This fork modifies the original project by changing the syntax for use with Denizen commands and Denizen scripts.
